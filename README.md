Finished my second Udemy Golang course (Lectures: 209, Video: 14.5 total hours) in 20 days, my roadmap is moving stepwise and am committed for the track for both Go and Python for

# Cloud, Network Programming, Operating System Programming, Automation Tools, Web Applications and Microservices

This course was very interesting, the instructor Romanian @Andrei Dumitrescu was ultimately patient, with clear language, sound of skillfulness in the architecture of Golang, he covered broad if not most of the critical topics, gave some notes, tips, do's and dont's, ...etc

I've purchased all instructor courses for the same area of interests and highly recommend to take this course for self-paced learning the fundamental basics of Go (but complete not missing any concept)

I'm going to regularly update and enrich this repo for more side projects in areas above.
